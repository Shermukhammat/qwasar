# Welcome to My Ngram
***

## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
Mainly the trouble I had was creating the makefile and saving the enumerable characters!
## Description
How have you solved the problem?
I was wondering how to store the chars as many times as they came! 
But I found out that it is very easy! I put them in an array of 128 characters! 
Makephilham isn't as hard as I thought!
## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
I used the standard libraries <stdio.h> , <string.h> and created my first library "mylib.h"!
## Usage
How does it work?But they won't flower like they did last spring
This program takes the data entered in the terminal and puts it in my datapro() function, 
and this function counts how many characters are used in this data and passes it to my dataprint() function, 
and this function prints the received answer to the board! I wrote my functions in a separate file in this 
program and found that it made the programming process very easy! I also wrote a Makefile that allows me to 
run all the files for all my projects at once!

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
